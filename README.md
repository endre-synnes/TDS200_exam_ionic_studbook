# TDS200 Exam #

##### In this Exam I have created an App using the Ionic Framework


The assignment was to create an App where students can sell and buy 
used school books. Users who want to sell books should be able to upload books for sale.

Users should also be able to see all books for sale.

We should also use Firebase Cloud Firestore as a Database


### My solution

In my solution i have used the following NPM modules:

 - Camera
 - Geolocation
 - Barcode Scanner
 
 
Users can add new books for sale, when doing so users can scan the ISBN bar code on the book,
and information from Google Books API will fill out the information about this book.

Users can also send messages to the sellers. Sellers can then respond and mark the book as sold.

Every user can see all books he/she has for sale, and all sold books.


While creating a new profile users can also add a profile picture.
